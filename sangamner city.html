         “ Amrutvahini Sheti & Shikshan Vikas Santha is a premier institution in the educational field in Maharashtra.<br>
     It efficiently and most qualitatively runs mainly technical and professional courses; and is well- known on the <br>
     state and national level for its highest academic standard. This institution organises a grand cultural festival<br>
      known as 'MEDHA' every year from 2016. Medha connotes intelligence. This is perhaps the second largest cultural<br>
       festival in the state, the first being The Malhar Festival, Mumbai. The thought of organising such a grand festival<br>
       on Amrutvahini was conceptualised by Rajwardhan Thorat; and it was successfully materialised by the Sanstha under the<br>
        guidance of Mrs. Sharayu Deshmukh - Trustee of the Institution. ‘Medha’ provides an opportunity to the enthusiastic<br>
         youth to showcase their hidden talents & skills. More than 10,000 students and nearly double number of parents whole<br>
          heartedly enjoy this festival every year.

        Amrutvahini Sheti & Shikshan Vikas Sanstha was founded in 1978 by the visionary leader Doyen of the cooperative <br>
        movement and great philanthropist, the late Hon. Sahakar Maharshi Bhausaheb Santuji Thorat. In the late 1970s,<br>
         Sangamner was a backward region plagued by social evils like poverty, illiteracy, drought, and unemployment.<br>
          Hon. Bhausaheb Thorat was determined to change this situation and believed education was the key to progress.<br>
           He envisioned a Sanstha that would provide affordable and accessible education to the poor, regardless of their <br>
           caste or creed. The Sanstha was established with the vision of providing quality education and technical training<br>
            to the rural masses of Sangamner taluka in Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra.<br>
            <br>
        His legacy is well carried forward by his Son, Former Revenue Minister and AICC invitee Member, President of <br>
        Amrutvahini Sheti & Shikashn Vikas Sanstha Hon. Shri. Balasaheb Thorat Saheb and equally supported by Former<br> 
        MLC and Trustee Hon. Dr. Sudhir Tambe Saheb. The path laid by all these great visionary leaders is well kept <br>
        and marched forward by his granddaughter, Trustee Hon. Mrs. Shrayu Ranjit Deshmukh Madam.<br>
